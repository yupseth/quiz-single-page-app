### _Single Page Application_

ðŸ“±ðŸ’» â†’ [Click here to try it out](https://yupseth.github.io/quiz-single-page-app/)

> This project was designed as a learning environment, in the light of the recently acquired understanding of web development fundamentals.

## About

QUIZLE is a responsive single page web application using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. It relies on JavaScript to fetch the quiz questions and answers, assess the latter's suitability, and accordingly keep the userâ€™s score. Once exhausting the ten multiple choice questions, it displays the final result.

Please consider that the content of this app (categories, questions and answers, along with their truth value) is exclusively dependent on the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com). Hence the possibility of unavailable questions for certain categories and difficulty levels, or even inaccuracy of expression and correctness.

## Tutorial

- Choose one of the provided categories
- Select the difficulty level using the difficulty slider or the corresponding buttons, then press start
- Once selected an answer, a visual feedback is given with respect to its validity
- The next button advances to next questions, respectively to the result.
- The reset button brings the user back to the home screen.

## Demo

## Personal Objective

As mentioned before, this quiz was meant to serve as a facilitating environment for internalising the key concepts of web development.

Following the completion of several tutorials, I found myself in a position of becoming familiar with considerable amounts of new concepts, but not quite comfortable with a more hands-on approach of using them.

Thus, Quizle came as a pretext of getting more comfortable with API calls, DOM manipulation, and overall the entire process of creating a fully functional application.

### Challanges

As a self-taught web developer, there was no scarcity of challenges throughout the development processes of this project. However, they concluded in a set of **_valuable knowledge aquisitions_**:

#### JavaScript:

- Understanding how API calls work
- Improving the understanding of manipulating large collections of data
- Managing to alternate between different stages of game-play in a single page app
- Populating the dropdown options using DOM manipulation
- Generating answer buttons with predictable behaviour using DOM manipulation

#### CSS:

- Implementing a way of hiding the irrelevant screens in accordance with the game-stage
- Displaying consistent (and responsive) styles for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
- Creating custom difficulty slider
- Creating an animated loader

#### Git:

- Working with local and remote branches
